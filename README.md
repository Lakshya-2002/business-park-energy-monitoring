**⚡ Business Park Energy Monitoring System**
End-to-End IoT + Azure + Medallion Architecture Solution

This solution is designed to monitor, store, and analyze energy usage data from a business park using Azure's modern data platform, following the Medallion architecture pattern (🥉 Bronze, 🥈 Silver, 🥇 Gold layers).

📡 Data Ingestion via Azure IoT Hub
Smart energy meters installed across the business park continuously send real-time telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub.
This hub acts as the central ingestion point, ensuring:

--Secure device-to-cloud communication
--Scalable data flow
--Reliable event streaming

🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Data Storage
The raw data received from IoT Hub is ingested and stored in the Bronze layer of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
This layer maintains data in its original form, supporting:

-Data traceability
-Backup and disaster recovery



🥈 Silver Layer – Cleaned and Enriched Data
Data from the Bronze layer is processed using Azure Databricks, where it undergoes:

-Data cleaning and validation
-Transformation and schema enforcement

The output is structured and stored in the Silver layer, making it ready for downstream analytics and reporting.



🥇 Gold Layer – Data Warehouse (Business-Critical Insights)
Processed data from the Silver layer is then loaded into a centralized Data Warehouse, typically powered by Azure Synapse Analytics, enabling:

-High-performance querying
-Enterprise-grade analytical workloads

The Gold layer serves as the single source of truth and powers:

📊 Advanced analytics and trend forecasting

📈 Energy efficiency and peak usage insights

🧠 Predictive modeling & anomaly detection

📉 Cost-saving & optimization strategies

🖥️ Real-time and historical dashboards via Power BI
